# Insanity Check: Reimagined

## Description

A reimagined version of our iconic Insanity Check: Redux challenge from UTCTF 2023.

The flag is in CTFd this time, but, as always, you'll have to work for it.

(Specifically the CTFd instance hosting utctf.live)

(This challenge does not require any brute-force -- as per the rules of the competition,
brute-force tools like dirbuster are not allowed, and will not help you here.)
